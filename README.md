# Project Overview
Durring my winter break I had some free time on my hands. I recenty got two arduinos for christmas and found an old knex coaster in my basement. I managed to fabricate a small little loop da loop coaster with what parts I had. Then I decided I wanted to automate the coaster using the arduino. Next thing I knew I had build a coaster that was fully automated using the code found in the ardino folder. However I wanted it to become connected to the internet of things. Using the knowledge and the tools availible I was able to do it using only javascript and some html and css.



# Required Materials
1. Computer Mac, Windows, Linux
2. Arduino and Arduino IDE (or off brand works fine too)
3. You will need to flash firmada to the Arduino in order for it to work with johnny-five.
4. Node.js and npm installed on your computer
5. npm install johhny-five 
6. npm install firebase
7. A text editor of your choice I prefer Atom or DreamWeaver but Sublime or Adobe Brackets are two other popular choices
8. Lots of jumper wires and 220ohm resistors

# Things you should know
This was my first time using firebase, node.js, johhny-five, and arduinos! So there are probably several errors or ways to simplify the code!
1. HTML
2. CSS
3. Javascript
4. Some basic knowledge of databases and JSON data

# IMPORTANT
Keep (app.js, index.html, & coasterStyles.css) together!
coasterBrain.js will need the dependecies specified in the package.JSON file. It also must connected to the arduino!
